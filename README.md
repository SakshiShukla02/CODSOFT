Attached are the completed tasks for the UI/UX internship provided to me by CODSOFT. 

The first task is the "Mobile app sign-up flow". It has been created with the help of Figma. 

The second task is the "Restaurant Menu". Here I have chosen to create the design for a seafood restaurant - SEAFORIA. It has been created using Canva, however the template is original. The idea is influenced by aesthetic pinterest boards.  

The third task is the "E-Commerce website". Here the name of the website is - INORA. This task has also been created using Canva. 

All the three tasks are completely original and have not been copied from anywhere, the ideas are influenced by pinterest and myself.
